Learning Database with ORACLE SQL

Topics

  Data - Presentation of facts, information, or concepts which are created in a computer readable form or translated into such a form.
  Database - A  collection of information that is organized for easy management, update and access.
  Database Management System (DBMS) - is a software package designed to create, store, and manage databases.

  Understand SQL
    (https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/intro.htm)

    Structured Query Language (SQL) is the set of statements with which all programs and users access data in an Oracle database. Application programs and Oracle tools often allow users access to the database without using SQL directly, but these applications in turn must use SQL when executing the user's request. This chapter provides background information on SQL as used by most database systems.
                       
    History of SQL
      Dr. E. F. Codd published the paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks", in June 1970 in the Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) journal, Communications of the ACM. Codd's model is now accepted as the definitive model for relational database management systems (RDBMS). 

      The language, Structured English Query Language (SEQUEL) was developed by IBM Corporation, Inc., to use Codd's model. SEQUEL later became SQL (still pronounced "sequel"). In 1979, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle) introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL. Today, SQL is accepted as the standard RDBMS language.

Software Application
  Oracle Live SQL is a web-based tool that allows you to access an Oracle database without installing any software on your own computer. You can run SQL code to create objects, insert data, and select this data, all using your web browser.
